"""
This program is added to your ``$PATH`` when you install clubsandwich.
It repeatedly runs a command until you ctrl+c the ``babysit`` process.

Imagine you're working on a flame effect for your main screen. It takes
a lot of tweaking. Every time you make a change, you go to run your game::

  python flamegame.py

This is annoying. With ``babysit``, you can make it continuously relaunch
every time you quit, so as soon as you exit you see the latest code running
in seconds::

  babysit python flamegame.py

It will keep relaunching until you ctrl+c the ``babysit`` process.

Relaunches are never more often than 5 seconds, in case you've got a
crash-on-launch bug.
